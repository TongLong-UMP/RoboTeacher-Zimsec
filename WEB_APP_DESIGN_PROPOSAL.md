# RoboTeacher ZIMSEC: Project Proposal for Funding

## Executive Summary
RoboTeacher ZIMSEC is a transformative Flutter-based educational platform designed to revolutionize learning for Zimbabwean primary and secondary students (ECD to Grade 7, with potential expansion to secondary and tertiary levels). By leveraging human-technology collaboration, the app delivers ZIMSEC-aligned digital content, replacing hard-copy textbooks with interactive soft-copy resources and note-taking tools. It empowers students with guided learning, AI-driven feedback, and connections to human teachers or tutors, while enabling parents to monitor progress and teachers to manage assignments. With culturally relevant assets, offline accessibility for rural schools, and a community hub for collaboration, RoboTeacher addresses educational disparities in Zimbabwe. This proposal seeks $120,000 to develop, test, and deploy the platform by 2026, targeting 100,000 students, with a focus on resource-scarce rural areas through offline tablet distribution.

## 1. Problem Statement
Zimbabwe’s education system faces significant challenges:
- **Resource Scarcity**: Rural schools lack textbooks, digital tools, and qualified teachers, limiting learning opportunities.
- **Digital Divide**: Limited internet access hinders e-learning adoption, particularly in underserved areas.
- **Outdated Methods**: Reliance on hard-copy textbooks restricts interactive and personalized learning.
- **Learning Gaps**: Students struggle with literacy and national exam performance due to insufficient feedback and resources.
- **Parental Engagement**: Parents lack tools to monitor children’s progress effectively.

RoboTeacher ZIMSEC addresses these issues by providing an offline-capable, interactive platform that replaces textbooks, integrates AI for personalized feedback, and fosters collaboration among students, teachers, parents, and tutors, with a focus on rural accessibility.
